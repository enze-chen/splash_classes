# Splash Classes
This repository contains course material that I've used for my Splash classes. Splash is a world-wide educational outreach program hosted at various universities where university affiliates teach classes on *any* topic of their choosing to middle and high school students. The umbrella organization that helps Splash programs grow is [Learning Unlimited](https://www.learningu.org/).

## [Stanford Splash](https://stanfordesp.org/)
I first joined Splash as a teacher and admin during my freshman fall quarter at Stanford University. I did my undergrad (Materials Science and Engineering) and Masters (Computational and Mathematical Engineering) at Stanford, from Fall Quarter 2014 through Fall Quarter 2018. During that time, I taught at just about every Fall and Spring Splash!

More information can be found in the [stanford folder](stanford/README.md).

## [Berkeley Splash](https://berkeley.learningu.org/)
My first time ever visiting Berkeley was for my Splash class that I taught as an ambassador in Fall 2018. I was still finishing my Masters degree at Stanford at the time. The next time I visited Berkeley was for a PhD visit weekend, after which I committed to the PhD program in Materials Science and Engineering, starting Fall 2019. Hopefully this means many more Splashes in the future!
