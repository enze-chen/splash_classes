# Berkeley Splash

## 2018 Fall
This was my first time visiting Berkeley despite coming to the Bay Area four years prior. I taught an Introduction to West Coast Swing class with my high school classmate Ting Ding, who was an undergrad at Berkeley at the time. Though she had never social danced before, she was an amazing follow!

## 2020 Spring
I started a PhD in Materials Science and Engineering at UC Berkeley in the Fall, which meant more Berkeley Splash! This time around, I taught a class on the characteristics of quality figures. We started with a narrative of the cholera epidemic and the Challenger disaster, and then went through an interactive exercise of fixing a plot. My friend Han-Ming Hau, another first-year MSE PhD student, was my coteacher. Though we had a really small class due to the encroaching COVID-19 pandemic, my students were lovely and I think we all got a lot out of the class! I also reprised my Parents Program talk about how to have a fulfilling high school/undergraduate life, and it was equally well-received by the Berkeley parents. Many of them were also double Berkeley-Stanford alums!
